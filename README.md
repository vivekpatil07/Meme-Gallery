##Assignment
Create a gallery of memes using NextJS that renders posts from reddit.com/r/memes.

#Instructions
•
You can use reddit's API to fetch the thumbnail and url for each post.

•
You can use the Photoswipe library to implement the gallery. Clicking on a thumbnail in the gallery should display the image in its full resolution.

•
Also, the gallery should scroll infinitely. You can fetch more entries using the after attribute (as the user scrolls down).
